# Developed-Custom-RAG-Model-FastAPI
I've developed a custom RAG model that enables users to upload files (.pdf, .docx, & .txt) and scrape web content for querying. You can then query either your uploaded files (via a knowledge graph) or leverage AI LLMs, including Gemini, OpenAI, and Llama.


Developed custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model:
This RAG model includes two key functionalities to provide efficient querying:

### 1. File Upload Support:
- Users can upload files in various formats, such as .pdf, .docx, and .txt. The system processes these files and builds a knowledge graph, enabling structured representation of the extracted content. Users can directly query this knowledge graph to retrieve relevant information.

### 2. Web Scraping Capability:
- The model incorporates web scraping tools to gather dynamic and up-to-date information from the internet, complementing the knowledge graph with live content for broader retrieval options.

### 3. Flexible Query Options:
Users can choose between:
- Knowledge Graph Querying: Extract information exclusively from uploaded files using the organized content representation.
- AI Language Models: Employ advanced generative models, such as Gemini, OpenAI, or Llama, to handle queries with contextual depth and reasoning, offering broader and more sophisticated results.

This system bridges structured document knowledge with cutting-edge AI capabilities, providing users with a versatile platform for both static and dynamic content retrieval.
